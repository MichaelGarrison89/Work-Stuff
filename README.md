# Work-Stuff
This is a parent folder where I'll keep as many work-related R programs as I can.

### Weather Infographic
Shows the quarterly weather graphs I put together. All the data is from the National Weather Service. My objective with the graphs is to show the most interesting thing about the quarter for at least one of the three important weather stations in the Eversource service territory: Concord, Hartford, and Boston.


### DEWM Model
Contains the R code for the DEWM Model. DEWM (Demand, Exponential Weighting Method) estimates monthly demand revenues based on historical hourly load data.
